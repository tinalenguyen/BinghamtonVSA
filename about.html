     <h1> About Us</h1>
    The Vietnamese Student Associationâ€™s goals are to educate ourselves and the University about Vietnamese culture and issues related to the Vietnamese community, to increase the Vietnamese representation in organizations which are supposed to serve the Asian community, to encourage cultural, social and political awareness among Asian and Asian-American students, to promote interaction with other cultural unions, to provide the Student Association with an Asian and Asian-American perspective, and to help new students adjust to university life. VSA is a sub-group of the Asian Student Union (ASU) along with its six other members, Asian Outlook, the Binghamton University Japanese Association, the Chinese American Student Union, the Korean American Student Association, the Philippine American League, and the Taiwanese American Student Coalition. With this large organization, a major goal is to promote unity and boost confidence among Asian and Asian-American students.
